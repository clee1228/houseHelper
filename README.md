Across demographics, communication and accountability are essential to developing a comfortable living environment. Conflicting schedules, lack of motivation and commitment, and varying individual standards, can create difficulty delegating/ completing tasks such as household chores and shopping for household items. Even with tasks delegated, it is often burdensome to hold oneself and others accountable for completing tasks on time. 

This is an app thatâ€™s directly accessible to all people living in a house helps keep track of tasks and responsibilities. It can help create a sense of accountability and commitment, and improve relationships within the household -- all while accommodating to individual schedules and preferences. This application assists housemates in organizing their chores and communal shopping needs resulting in healthier living relations.
